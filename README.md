# Quinote-Second-Draft

### Issues/Considerations

* Quit doesn't refresh quiz
* Undefined definitions (when definition is empty)

* Missing </div> in frontend.html

* When parsing dates, white space matters in most places but not all

* List items may need better formatting
* List is not scrollable and can push quiz button off screen

* Editor-specific issues
	* Not all toolbar buttons linked
	* Formatting resets on Return/Enter
	* User's desire to create a list not handled for them
